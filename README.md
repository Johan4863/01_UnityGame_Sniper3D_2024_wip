Welcome to **Sniper3D**, a unique sniper simulation game where you navigate a tabletop setting, strategically eliminating targets while avoiding detection.

## Gameplay Overview

In **Sniper3D**, you control a sniper on a tabletop environment filled with toy soldiers, guards, and civilians. Your primary objective is to silently eliminate the main target without triggering alarms. Here are the key elements of the gameplay:

- **Stealthy Elimination**: Use stealth and precision to take out the main target without alerting guards or civilians.
- **Tabletop Environment**: Navigate a detailed tabletop scenario where toy soldiers patrol and guards watch for suspicious activity.
